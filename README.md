Hello again, second tutorial on how to build a website using Express.js. A different approach. Good tutorial again. 

See you again. 

[Update 23/5]

Working on my second tutorial from http://line25.com/tutorials/build-a-basic-dribbble-fed-portfolio-website-part-22 . Another good tutorial but this time I code it using express.js instead of HTML. 

I'm at the aha phrase. 

See you again.
